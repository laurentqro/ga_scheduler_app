## GA Schedule Planner

GA just keeps growing and growing. They need a new app to manage courses, students, instructors and classrooms.

You are going to develop an app to handle the planning and booking, and to allow students and staff to access all the information.

It's very important that students are restricted in their abilities in the app, and that GA staff can manage the system.
